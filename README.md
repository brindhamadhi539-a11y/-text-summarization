# -text-summarization
This is a minimal example of Deep Learning applied to Natural Language Processing (NLP). The project uses a powerful pre-trained Transformer model (T5-small) to automatically read a long block of text and generate a concise summary. This is an excellent starting point for anyone new to Machine Learning or the Hugging Face ecosystem.
